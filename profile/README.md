<h3 align="center">The Meta–Infrastructure for the Agentic Web</h3>

<p align="center">
  <i>Weava Labs is building the open meta-infrastructure that allows AI Agents to register, discover, and collaborate across a distributed network.</i>
</p>

## 🌍 Vision

**Weava** aims to establish the **meta-infrastructure layer** for the emerging Agentic Web —  
a unified foundation where any Agent, regardless of the framework it’s built on  
(<code>A2A</code>, <code>MCP</code>, <code>BeeAI</code>, <code>LangChain</code>, <code>Browser-use</code>, etc.),  
can seamlessly connect, communicate, and collaborate.

> 🕸️ Instead of creating another agent, Weava helps you **weave** the entire Agentic Web together.

## 🧩 Core Architecture

Weava Labs develops the **Weava Agentic Framework (WAF)** —  
a modular, distributed infrastructure composed of multiple interoperable layers:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧠 Weava Framework │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Registry Layer — Global Agent directory │
│ 2. Discovery Layer — Semantic search & match │
│ 3. Session Layer — Cross-agent collaboration │
│ 4. Mesh Layer — Distributed connectivity │
│ 5. Governance Layer — Trust, policy & audit │
│ 6. Integration Layer — A2A, MCP, BeeAI, etc. │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🧱 Core Components
- 🗂️ **Registry** — where agents register their skills, metadata, and endpoints.  
- 🔍 **Discovery** — semantic search for agent capabilities and intent alignment.  
- 💬 **Session** — context and dialogue management across multiple agents.  
- 🌐 **Mesh** — real-time distributed communication layer.  
- 🛡️ **Governance** — manages trust, permissions, auditing, and policies.

## 🔗 Design Philosophy

### 1. **Protocol-Agnostic**
Weava doesn’t replace A2A, MCP, or BeeAI — it supports all of them.  
Any Agent following an open protocol can register and operate on the Weava network.

### 2. **Distributed by Design**
Every module can run independently across distributed nodes — no centralized controller required.

### 3. **Composable Infrastructure**
Each layer is modular, extensible, and replaceable for different deployment models.

### 4. **Open & Extensible**
All SDKs, APIs, and schemas are open to enable global collaboration and interoperability.

## 💡 Example: Agentic Task Lifecycle on Weava

1. 🧭 The user sends an intent: “Find recent research on renewable energy.”  
2. 🧩 The Weava Registry identifies agents capable of *Research + Knowledge Retrieval*.  
3. ⚙️ The Real-Time Router selects the best agent based on skill vectors.  
4. 💬 The Session Layer opens a shared collaboration context.  
5. 🧠 Agents cooperate, exchange insights, and return an aggregated result.

## 🚀 Objectives of Weava Labs

| 🎯 Objective | Description |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Open Infrastructure SDK** | Enable developers to self-host agentic meshes without relying on centralized platforms. |
| **Meta-Layer Compatibility** | Provide seamless interoperability for A2A, MCP, BeeAI, Browser-use, LangChain, etc. |
| **Federated Discovery Network** | Allow multiple registries to interconnect and synchronize globally. |
| **Governance & Trust Framework** | Establish standards for transparency, safety, and auditability in the Agentic Web. |

## 🧭 Long-Term Vision

> “Weava aims to become the **neural layer** of the Agentic Web —  
> where agents don’t just act, but truly understand and collaborate.”
